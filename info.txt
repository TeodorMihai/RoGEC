typo generator:
    https://github.com/wsong/Typo-Distance/blob/master/typodistance.py
    -based on Knuth algorithm
    -insertion more likely than deletion

from andrew paper:
    -rare words?
    -word level nn with fixed vocabulary - poorly suited for oov (years)
    -character level works because you only need to copy inpuut -> output (attention si crucial + pyramid structure)
    -combine with a language model (reranker)
    -controlling precision: 
    -multiple way to correct a sentence -> blue not accuracy
    -synthetic errors:  article or determiner errors and noun number errors
    -rich morpholofy -> character levels
    -evaluated on how well its proposed corrections or edits match the gold-standard edits
    -scores for n-grams to detect errors
